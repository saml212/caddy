# CAD Agent System

This repository hosts a system of agents designed to help engineers with CAD modeling tasks, built using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK).

## Overview

The CAD Agent System leverages the FreeCAD MCP (Mission Control Protocol) as a submodule to provide an intelligent assistant framework for CAD design tasks. The system uses Google's ADK to create specialized agents that can understand and assist with various aspects of CAD modeling.
